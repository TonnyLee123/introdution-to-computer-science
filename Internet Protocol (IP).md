# The Internet Protocol (IP) 
 - a protocol, or set of rules. 
 - for routing and addressing packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination.
 - 
Data traversing the Internet is divided into smaller pieces, called packets. 
IP information is attached to each packet, and this information helps **routers** to send packets to the right place. 
Every device or domain that connects to the Internet is assigned an IP address, and as packets are directed to the IP address attached to them, data arrives where it is needed.

Once the packets arrive at their destination, they are handled differently depending on which transport protocol is used in combination with IP. The most common transport protocols are TCP and UDP.

# So what is an IP address and why does it matter?
‘IP’ stands for Internet Protocol, which is the set of rules that makes it possible for devices to communicate over the Internet. With billions of people accessing the Internet every day, unique identifiers are necessary to keep track of who is doing what. The Internet Protocol solves this by assigning IP numbers to every device accessing the Internet.
